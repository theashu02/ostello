        NEET 2026 Exam Pattern
      </h3>
      <p className="text-justify mb-2">
        The NEET UG 2026 exam will follow a revised pattern, reverting to the
        pre-COVID format. The exam will be conducted in pen-and-paper mode
        (OMR-based), and candidates will mark their answers on the OMR sheet. It
        will consist of 180 compulsory multiple-choice questions (MCQs) divided
        across three subjects: Physics (45 questions), Chemistry (45 questions),
        and Biology (90 questions, with 45 each from Botany and Zoology).
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify tracking-tight mb-3">
        The total duration of the exam will be 180 minutes (3 hours), with no
        additional time provided. Each correct answer will earn 4 marks, while 1
        mark will be deducted for each incorrect answer, and unattempted
        questions will carry no marks. One key change for NEET UG is the removal
        of Section B, which previously included optional questions. This means
        that all 180 questions will be mandatory for candidates, ensuring a
        uniform and fair exam experience for all.
